## My Projects:
* [Nike Warehouse Management system](https://github.com/4rr0wh34d/final_capstone)
  - This project was created in order to help in the management and organisation of Nike warehouse. The project helps the user to keep track of the shoe inventory, restock it, search for certain shoe product and manage excess shoes. It is based in the concept of object oriented programming.
* [Task Manager](https://github.com/4rr0wh34d/Task_Manager)
  - This Project was developed in order to help the user to keep track of user and their tasks. The user with administrator privilege is able to create users and assign them with their tasks. The user can also modify, delete, search and view the tasks.
* [TicTacToe](https://github.com/4rr0wh34d/TicTacToe_console)
  - This project is the well known game of tictactoe. It was purely coded in python
* [NLP](https://github.com/4rr0wh34d/NLP)
  - A collection of code snippets that demonstrates the use of semantic similarity of spacy's 'en-core-web-md' model between different things.
* [Minesweeper](https://github.com/4rr0wh34d/minesweeper)
  - This project is basically an algorithm to determine the number of mine represented by '#' around the current location and print the amount of mine.
* [Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/4rr0wh34d/Movie_recommendation)
  - This project is based on similarity model of spacy modules where a function takes a movie description as an argument and compare it to a list of movies'
description from a file and recommend the user to watch the movie with the most similar description.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Bookstore Management System Gui](https://github.com/4rr0wh34d/Bookstore-Management-System)
  - A Gui based python program based in tkinter modules. It also uses sqlite database modules to record and maintain the book database and uses openpxl to manipulate the excel sheets. Here the concept of OOP has been used to break the program into multiple files and also for reusability. This project will also feature an EPOS functionality that will help in recording the day to day sales.

## Future projects
* Store Manager or EPOS:
  - This project would allow the user to manage and organise the store. It would help to keep record of day to day transactions, maintain the database of the products sold and retrieves it for calculation, allows user to enter new product into database, calculate and generate daily,weekly and monthly reports and use similarity model to predict the products likely to be famous based on the highest selling products. 

* TicTacToe GUI: 
  - This would be a GUI modification to my console based games.It would be based in tkinter modules.

## Looking Forward:
As a junior software engineer i am looking to onboard a company that would help me to learn and grow into an ultimate software developer, yet at the same time get the most out of me. I have also plan on working toward Software Define Networking using REST API to automate Network devices like routers and switches.
